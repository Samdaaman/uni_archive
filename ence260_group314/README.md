<h1>CAPTURE THE FLAG</h1>

A Capture the Flag game designed for UC Funkits

Authors: Sam Hogan, Henry Seaton

<h2>SET UP</h2>

Place the two UC Funkits opposite each other so that the IR transmitter and receiver are aligned.
After compiling, one player must push down on the navswitch to start the game.
This player will be able to select the maximum score needed to reach before winning, and can select this with the navswitch before pushing down to confirm.

The game will then begin and both players and flags will be displayed.


<h2>GAMEPLAY</h2>

The aim of each round is to capture the opponent's flag on their screen and then make it back to your side.
Move the navswitch to move your player.
You can move freely across both screens, however if the other player has crossed onto your half you cannot cross onto their side.

If an opponent is on your side, you can tag them by moving your player into them. 
This will reset the opponent's player to their side, and if they have collected the flag it will also be reset.

To collect the flag, move your player onto the flag location.

To score a point, you must cross the half way mark after having collected the opponent's flag.


<h2>SCORE</h2>

After each round, the score for each player will be displayed. Either player can push down on the navswitch to begin the next round.
If a player has reached the winning score, selected at the start of the game, a "W" will be displayed on their screen to indicate this.
Once a player has won, pushing down on the navswitch will begin a new game and reset both player's scores.
